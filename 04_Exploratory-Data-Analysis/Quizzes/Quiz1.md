Question 1
----------
Which of the following is a principle of analytic graphics?
* Don't plot more than two variables at at time
* Show box plots (univariate summaries)
* Make judicious use of color in your scatterplots
* Only do what your tools allow you to do
* Show causality, mechanism, explanation

Solution: </br>
Show causality, mechanism, explanation

Question 2
----------
What is the role of exploratory graphs in data analysis?
* They are typically made very quickly.
* Only a few are constructed.
* Axes, legends, and other details are clean and exactly detailed.
* They are made for formal presentations.

Solution: </br>
They are typically made very quickly.

Question 3
----------
Which of the following is true about the base plotting system?
* Plots are created and annotated with separate functions
* The system is most useful for conditioning plots
* Plots are typically created with a single function call
* Margins and spacings are adjusted automatically depending on the type of plot and the data

Solution: </br>
Plots are created and annotated with separate functions

Question 4
----------
Which of the following is an example of a valid graphics device in R?
* A socket connection
* A PDF file
* The keyboard
* A file folder

Solution: </br>
A PDF file

Question 5
----------
Which of the following is an example of a vector graphics device in R?
* GIF
* JPEG
* TIFF
* PNG
* SVG

Solution: </br>
SVG

Question 6
----------
Bitmapped file formats can be most useful for
* Scatterplots with many many points
* Plots that are not scaled to a specific resolution
* Plots that require animation or interactivity
* Plots that may need to be resized

Solution: </br>
Scatterplots with many many points

Question 7
----------
Which of the following functions is typically used to add elements to a plot in the base graphics system?
* plot()
* hist()
* text()
* boxplot()

Solution: </br>
text()

Question 8
----------
Which function opens the screen graphics device on Windows?
* jpeg()
* windows()
* xfig()
* postscript()

Solution: </br>
windows()

Question 9
----------
What does the 'pch' option to par() control?
* the line width in the base graphics system
* the size of the plotting symbol in a scatterplot
* the orientation of the axis labels on the plot
* the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system

Solution: </br>
the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system

Question 10
----------
If I want to save a plot to a PDF file, which of the following is a correct way of doing that?
* Open the screen device with quartz(), construct the plot, and then close the device with dev.off().
* Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF file with dev.copy2pdf()
* Construct the plot on the PNG device with png(), then copy it to a PDF with dev.copy2pdf().
* Open the PostScript device with postscript(), construct the plot, then close the device with dev.off().

Solution: </br>
Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF file with dev.copy2pdf()
